# Early-childhood-longitudinal-Study
The data file contains the public-use item-level data for the Social Rating Scale (SRS) Approaches to Learning scales used in the parent and teacher questionnaires of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K).

The data file contains the child identification number (CHILDID). To merge this information with the data on the main data file, researchers should merge by this identification number.

This document contains the SRS survey items that comprise the parent and teacher Approaches to Learning scales as fielded to parents and teachers, followed by information on how the subscales were constructed.

Fall kindergarten [variables on the file begin with P1]

 Spring first grade [variables on the file begin with P4]

The parent SRS was not fielded in the third-, fifth-, or eighth-grade data collections.
The teacher Approaches to Learning SRS scale was fielded:
 Fall kindergarten [variables on the file begin with T1]
 Spring kindergarten [variables on the file begin with T2]
 Spring first grade [variables on the file begin with T4]
